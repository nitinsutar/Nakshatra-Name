# Sources & Next Steps

This project currently uses an internal seeded curated dataset.

Planned Phase 1 (merge authoritative sources):
- Licensed baby-name databases / books
- Public records and popularity lists
- Human editors for verification

All merged names will be recorded with `source` and `verified` fields in `lib/curated_names.js`.
